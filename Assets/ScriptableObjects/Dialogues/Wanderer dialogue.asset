  - Hey, young human
  - It's a pleasure to meet a human in a long time
  - I've been here for over 4 days
  - And I don't really know if I will be able to go to the town
  - You see...
  - There are quite a few monsters near the boat of mine
  - I use that boat to travel across the sea
  - And when I came here 4 days ago, I thought of leaving but those mosters tried
    to kill me
  - So if you don't mind...
  - Please kill those mosters.
